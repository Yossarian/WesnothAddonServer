#define SET_OBJECTIVES SIDE SUMMARY_TEXT NOTE_TEXT CONDITION_WML
    # Sets the objectives for a given player
    # Side 0 means every player. Does not affect gameplay,
    # except that it tells the player what the objectives of a scenario are.
    #
    # For example, we could set the objective for all players to: "survive for
    # 3 turns" with this:

    #
    # For example we could tell player 2 to win by killing all other players

    # (marked red).
    #
    # For example we could tell all players that they lose if they die.

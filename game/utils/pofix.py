# pofix - perform string fixups on incoming .po files.
#
# The purpose of this script is to save translators from having to
# apply various string fixes needed before stable release by hand.  It is
# intended to be run on each incoming .po file as the Lord of
# Translations receives it.  However, translators may run it on their
# own .po files to be sure, as a second application will harmlessly do
# nothing.
#
# To use this script, give it one or more paths to .po files as
# command-line arguments.  Each file will be tweaked as needed.
# It should work on Windows and MacOS X as well as Linux, provided
# you have Python installed.
#
# This script will emit a report line for each file it modifies,
# and save a backup copy of the original with extension "-bak".
#
# This script will tell you when it is obsolete.  Run it against all .po
# files in the main Wesnoth tree; when it says none are older than this script,
# it can be discarded (assunming that it has in fact been used to transform
# all incoming .po files in the meantime).
#
# Example usage:
# utils/pofix.py po/wesnoth*/*.po*
# find data/campaigns/ -name '*.cfg' -print0 | xargs -0 utils/pofix.py
#
# Three lines in the structure below, marked with "#*", imply changes of
# meaning that may require a change in translation.

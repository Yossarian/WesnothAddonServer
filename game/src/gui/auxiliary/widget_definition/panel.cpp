 * A panel is always enabled and can't be disabled. Instead it uses the
 * states as layers to draw on.
 *
 * The resolution for a panel also contains the following keys:
 * @start_table = config
 *     top_border (unsigned = 0)     The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area.
 *     bottom_border (unsigned = 0)  The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area.
 *     left_border (unsigned = 0)    The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area.
 *     right_border (unsigned = 0)   The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area.
 * @end_table
 *
 * The following layers exist:
 * * background, the background of the panel.
 * * foreground, the foreground of the panel.

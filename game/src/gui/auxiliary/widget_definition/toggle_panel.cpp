 * == Toggle panel ==
 *
 * The definition of a toggle panel. A toggle panel is like a toggle button, but
 * instead of being a button it's a panel. This means it can hold multiple child
 * items.
 *
 * The resolution for a toggle panel also contains the following keys:
 * @start_table = config
 *     top_border (unsigned = 0)     The size which isn't used for the client area.
 *     bottom_border (unsigned = 0)  The size which isn't used for the client area.
 *     left_border (unsigned = 0)    The size which isn't used for the client area.
 *     right_border (unsigned = 0)   The size which isn't used for the client area.
 * @end_table
 *
 * The following layers exist:
 *
 * The following states exist:
 * * state_enabled, the panel is enabled and not selected.
 * * state_disabled, the panel is disabled and not selected.
 * * state_focussed, the mouse is over the panel and not selected.
 *
 * * state_enabled_selected, the panel is enabled and selected.
 * * state_disabled_selected, the panel is disabled and selected.
 * * state_focussed_selected, the mouse is over the panel and selected.
